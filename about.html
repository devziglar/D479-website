    <p>Taniti offers diverse natural beauty, from its sandy and rocky beaches to its lush mountainous interior. Yellow Leaf Bay’s sandy shores are a favorite among visitors, providing the perfect escape for swimming, relaxing in hammocks, or enjoying simple pleasures like building sandcastles. Adventure seekers can hike up the centrally located active volcano along a designated trail with safety rails. The island also features 10 restaurants offering a mix of local seafood dishes, American-style meals, and Pan-Asian cuisine, as well as two supermarkets, smaller grocery stores, and a 24-hour convenience shop.

Lodging ranges from budget hostels to a large four-star resort, with many family-owned hotels and bed-and-breakfasts, all regulated and inspected by the government. While the beaches, rainforest, and volcano draw most visitors, Merriton Landing—on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay—offers attractions like a history museum, fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining, pubs, a microbrewery, dance club, movie theater, art galleries, bowling, and more. With a legal drinking age of 18 that is loosely enforced, the island’s pubs are a popular nighttime destination, operating daily from 9 a.m. to midnight.</p>
